# Django Project Setup

This document provides the steps to set up the Django project structure. Follow the instructions below to replicate the structure.

---

## Project Structure

- `config/`: Contains the Django project configuration files.
  - `settings/`: A folder to manage different settings environments.
    - `base.py`: Base settings common across all environments.
    - `development.py`: Settings specific to the development environment.
    - `production.py`: Settings specific to the production environment.
  - `urls.py`: Root URL configuration.
  - `wsgi.py`: WSGI entry-point for the application.
  - `asgi.py`: ASGI entry-point for the application.
- `project/`: Main folder to organize project-related apps and files.
  - `user/`: A Django app for managing user-related features.
    - Contains standard Django app structure (`models.py`, `views.py`, etc.).
- `venv/`: Python virtual environment.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
For Linux/MacOS:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate

### Step 3: Install Django
bash
Copy code
pip install django

### Step 4: Start a Django Project
bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject config

### Step 5: Organize Project Structure
Create a folder named project inside the root directory.
Create a folder named user inside the project folder.

### Step 6: Create a Django App
bash
Copy code
django-admin startapp user project/user

### Step 7: Configure Settings
Move the settings.py file from config/ to a new folder named settings/ inside config/.
Rename settings.py to base.py.
Create two new files:
development.py for development settings.
production.py for production settings.
Import the base.py settings in both development.py and production.py.
Running the Project
Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Apply migrations:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver

### Additional Notes
Use config/settings/development.py for local development.
Use config/settings/production.py for deployment.
Ensure to install additional dependencies as required for the project.
